## v3.3.2 - 2024-04-24

- Updated:
    - Allow to use const boolean in filters.
    - Allow to use 'optional' boolean in V2 Fields object. Please be aware we do not take that value into account yet.

    - Move to pnpm from yarn, given our other libraries also use pnpm

## v3.3.0 - 2024-02-29

- Added:
    - Significant performance improvement: Add cache for AJV field validation as the operation is expensive and can be
      called multiple times. The improvement is in the order of 10 times or higher especially when larger definitions
      are encountered
    - Expose jwt_vp_json format
- Updated:
    - Update to PEX models 2.2.2

    - Update to PEX models 2.2.0 which adds support for Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0
- Fixed:
    - Do not use path nested for sd-jwt

      detect and fix that, also providing a warning

## v3.0.1 - 2024-01-19

- Updated:
    - SD-JWT dependency updated to 0.2.0
    - SSS types updated to 0.18.1

## v3.0.0 - 2024-01-14

- Updated:
    - Updated logic to return holder DID when constructing presentation
- Fixed:
    - Issue with determining whether to generate submission data or not.

## v2.2.0 - 2023-10-12

- Updated:

## v2.1.2 and v2.1.1 - 2023-09-28

No changes except from some updated dependencies

## v2.1.0 - 2023-07-10

IMPORTANT: This release moves to @astronautlabs/jsonpathplus in favor of jsonpathplus, bringing a security improvement.
As such you may need to update your dependencies in case you have a more strict dependency manager like pnpm.

- Changed:
    - Move to @astronautlabs/jsonpathplus for improved Jsonpath security, whilst working on a permanent
      fix. ([#110](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/PEX/issues/110))

- Fixed:
    - Move to build-time compilation of schema's using AJV, instead of runtime. Fixes an issue with the Hermes engine in
      React-Native, next to bringing execution
      optimizations. ([#118](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/PEX/issues/118))
    - Add `name` property to `field` objects included in @sphereon/pex-models
      2.0.3. ([#123](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/PEX/pull/123))
    - Invalid name used in matches from selection
      results. ([#117](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/PEX/issues/117))
    - Fixed pick and count behaviour matching against all credentials instead of per input
      descriptor ([#115](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/PEX/issues/115))
    - Fixed matching logic because of wrong assumptions. Previously all credentials were matched against all input
      descriptors, now a match per input descriptor suffices, as long as all input descriptors have
      matches. ([#114](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/PEX/issues/114)
      and [#113](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/PEX/issues/113))

## v2.0.1 - 2023-05-01

- Fixed:
    - some wrong import paths were used from @sphereon/pex-models

## v2.0.0 - 2023-04-30

WARNING: This release has several [breaking changes](./README.md#breaking-changes).

Although we envision a V3 release, with some major refactoring and full support for V2 of the PE spec, this version
should be more usable in OpenID4VP scenario's and incorporates many fixes. As such we urge people to upgrade from V1 to
V2 of the library.

Refactored external methods. They now all have optional objects as argument. Fixing future extensibility and ordering of
arguments.
Added support for PEX models v2, fixing model/interface names for typescript reserved words. Added options which are
handy in OpenID4VP scenario's, like having separate presentation submissions, filtering on DIDs and Formats not denoted
in the specification etc.

- Added:
    - Allow to have an external presentation submission not part of the VP, especially handy in OpenID4VP use cases
    - Allow to filter against Verifiable Credential Formats, defined outside of a definition. This is handy for instance
      when OpenID4VP Relying Parties signal support for certain formats in their OpenID4VP metadata, but do not
      necessarily incorporate these in their definition(s).
    - Allow to filter against DID methods, defined outside of a definition. This is handy for instance when OpenID4VP
      Relying Parties signal support for certain DID methods in their OpenID4VP metadata, but do not necessarily
      incorporate these in their definition(s).
    - Matching of schema strings against the type property in a VC for V1, as this is being used in the wild
    - Allow issuance object to be present in a definition as it is being used in the wild

- Removed:
    - definitions of ssi-types (lib/types/SSI.types.ts)

- Changed:
    - Changed optional arguments to use objects, see the upgrade section of
      the [README](./README.md#v200-argument-and-result-objects-changed-slightly)
    - `presentationFrom` and `verifiablePresentationFrom` methods now return an object instead of the presentation
      directly. see the upgrade section of the [README](./README.md#v200-argument-and-result-objects-changed-slightly)
    - Certain non-state related methods have moved to static methods in the PEX class
    - method signatures are using common types from @sphereon/ssi-types
    - Credential Mapper from @sphereon/ssi-types is now used to create internal uniform VPs/VCs
    - Relax AJV errors
- Fixed:
    - No more need for _const and _enum models/properties in presentation definitions. They are now `const` and `enum` (
      fixed in OpenAPI model generation)
    - Set the format based on detection of the format instead of hard-coding it in the descriptor
    - Match subject is issuer against all subjects of a VC if present (not common)

## v1.1.6 - 2023-02-17

Add async callback for signing

- Updates:
    - The sign callback now supports both a synchronous and asynchronous callback, thanks to @TimoGlastra from our
      friends at @animo
    - Update dependencies

## v1.1.5 - 2023-01-10

Relax V1 schema URI handling

- Updates:
    - Relax V1 schema URI handling. Previously we required the URI to be an actual URI, but in the wild the URI is also
      used as a regular string. We now support that as well. In case we detect a http based URI we will perform some
      additional checks.

## v1.1.4 - 2022-10-26

Update dependencies

- Updates:
    - Update dependencies

## v1.1.3 - 2022-08-15

Bugfix release

- Fixed:
    - Json-path fix for when an array needs to be searched in a field filter. See README for how to search in an array,
      as not all JSON schema methods are supported in current verion.

## v1.1.2 - 2022-06-30

Bugfix release

- Added:
    - Add status object to evaluationResult which informs whether VCs would satisfy the Definition or not
- Fixed:
    - Some errors would be filtered out by mistake

## v1.1.1

Internal release because of forgotten merges

## v1.1.0 - 2022-05-30

Added support for jwt vc/vp, added support for async callbacks, fixed some issues with generating PresentationSubmission

- Added:
    - support for jwt vc
    - support for jwt vp
    - support for async callback when creating verifiable presentation (verifiablePresentationFromAsync)
- Changed:
    - verifiablePresentationFrom is deprecated
- Fixed:
    - handling of submission_requirement object
    - creation of presentation_submission
    - handling of unwrapped jwt verifiable credentials

## v1.0.2 - 2022-01-14

Added String.matchAll shim for React-Native compatibility. Will be removed later and updated with another solution, to
keep the deps to a minumum

- Fixed:
    - React-Native not working with matchAll regexes

## v1.0.1 - 2022-01-13

Some JWT VC related fixes in the deserialization and VC claim comparisons

- Fixed:
    - JWT exp and nbf values can be numbers
    - JWT issuer can be an object with id. Ensure we also check this value against the VC claim
    - Always ensure JWT timestamps are serialized as ISO date strings in the resulting VC

## v1.0.0 - 2022-01-13

This is the first stable PEX library that has complete support for V1 and V2 of the Presentation Exchange spec.

- Added:
    - Check for hashlinks in schemas for a V1 specification. If we encounter them we generate a warning we did not
      verify the hashlink, as unfortunately there are no current typescript libraries that support hashlink decoding.
- Changed:
    - `limitDisclosure` and `holderDids` arguments made optional everywhere. Do note that definitions that use some
      holder binding and/or selective disclosure require these arguments to be present, so we advise to always populate
      them
- Fixed
    - React-native has no support for look-behind in regexes. We used this in escaping JSONLD terms in JSON-paths.
      Replaced by some typescript logic.

## v0.7.0 - 2022-01-11

Escape JsonLD terms in json-paths. This allows path constructs like `$..@context` to be used in definitions. Improved
JWT VC handling.

- Added:
    - JSonLD terms like `@context` need to be escaped for the json-path library.
      As long as the @ is followed by one or more word-characters we internally escape it, so that the json-path library
      functions as one would expect.
- Changed:
    - We now have better JWT claim handling. We are using VC values from the JWT if present. Otherwise we use JWT claim
      values. If both are present we check them to be equal.
    - Documentation updates
- Fixed:
    - Format minimum was not properly handled the schema check
    - We translate \_const and \_enum from the OpenAPI models internally to their actual protected typescript keys (
      const and enum)
    - Different submission requirements and definition combinations where not counted properly

## v0.6.2 - 2021-12-31

No exports of internal structures anymore. Split internal and external interfaces and types

- Changed:
    - Moved internal types to separate file
    - Only export external interfaces and types

## v0.6.1 - 2021-12-31

Small improvements in the Credential interfaces, removal of exposure of internal structures in the PEX class. Small
bugfixes

- Changed:

    - Next to `@context` evaluation for V1 schema values, we now look at the `credentialSchema`
    - Seperated Credentials and VerifiableCredential public interfaces into JSON-LD and JWT versions

- Fixed:
    - We were exposing some internal structures in the PEX class
    - Group validation assumed an array being present, which could be a string

## v0.6.0 - 2021-12-29

---

**Breaking change: class and package renamed as of v0.6.0!**

As part of introducing Presentation Exchange v1 and v2 feature based detection support to our Presentation Exchange
library and not reaching version 1.X yet, we decided to change the name of both the package and the main entry class:

- The package was changed from `@sphereon/pe-js` to `@sphereon/pex`
- The main class was changed from `PEJS` to `PEX`. The latter class has internal feature detection support on the
  provided definition, delegating the actual implementation to the new `PEXv1` or `PEXv2` class internally. If you don't
  want the automatic feature detection you can also choose to use the `PEXv1` and `PEXv2` classes directly.

---

Add Presentation Exchange v2 support, separating JWT Verifiable Credentials and JSON-LD VerifiableCredentials
